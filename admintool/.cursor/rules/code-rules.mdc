When creating CSS styles for elements, always ensure the HTML elements use CSS class names, and that the CSS styles are created in a page.module.css file.

Always use class selectors, never element selectors, when putting code in page.modules.css.


When changing or creating code that involves the database, verify any data models against the database schema found in "/.sqlscripts/createdb.sql". Always use Postgres SQL syntax and the Postgres database driver. New code in the project should be using Postgres, not MySQL.

When writing Postgres SQL statements, never prefix table names with the schema. Always specify the schema by executing "SET search_path" before executing a query.
